How to Protect a Page With Verification-Page

1. Add the full path of the page you want to protect (including the PHP filename; it can't just be folder names, it should look like /foo/bar.php or /bar.php) to the $whitelist array on line 21 in verification.php.

2. Add the first snippet above the doctype declaration (<!DOCTYPE HTML>)

<?php
session_start();
if ($_SESSION["verified"]) {
?>

3. Add the second snippet after the closing html tag (</html>)

<?php
} else {
  header("Location: /verification.php?continue=" . $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]);
}
?>

4. Done!
