# Verification Page
A simple Page-Protection Verification page developed in [PHP](https://secure.php.net/); used to protect webpages you'd like only people who have access to a key to see.

## Requirements
* PHP â‰¥ 5.4

## Tutorial
1. Firstly, [download](https://github.com/henry7720/Verification-Page/archive/master.zip) all of the files in any way you please.
2. Next, open up [verification.php](verification.php) and replace the `$key` variable's value with your protection key. If you are aware of any particular pages you'd like to protect, add them to the `$whitelist` array. Make sure the page's path is a relative path with a slash before it.
3. Next, open up [php-snippets.txt](php-snippets.md) and follow the particular instructions for using the PHP snippets to protect the page.
4. Finally, create a new page with the PHP snippets (or just use our [pre-made example](example-of-use.php)) and that page will be protected, making sure that the page has been added to the whitelist.
**Note**: if you are confused, make sure to read the inline comments for further explanation.

## How to Protect a Page With Verification-Page

1. Add the full path of the page you want to protect (including the PHP filename; can't just be folder names, e.g. `/somepath/somerandompage.php` or `/somerandompage.php`) to the `$whitelist` array in [verification.php](verification.php)

2. Add the first snippet above the doctype declaration (`<!DOCTYPE HTML>`)

```
<?php
session_start();
if ($_SESSION["verified"]) {
?>
```

3. Add the second snippet after the closing html tag (`</html>`)

```
<?php
} else {
  header("Location: /verification.php?continue=" . $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]);
}
?>
```

4. **Done!**
