How to Protect a Page With Verification-Page

1. Add the full path of the page you want to protect (including the php filename; can't just be folder names, e.g. /somepath/somerandompage.php or /somerandompage.php) to the $whitelist array in verification.php

2. Add the first snippet above the doctype declaration (<!DOCTYPE HTML>)

<?php
session_start();
if ($_SESSION["verified"]) {
?>

3. Add the second snippet after the closing html tag (</html>), if you are protecting an index page, use the snippet on line 14. If you're inside of a path, however, you may use str_replace to make the URLs look cleaner as shown on line 22.

FOR INDEX PAGE;

<?php
} else {
  header("Location: /verification.php");
}
?>

IF NOT INDEX (OR IN DIRECTORIES);

<?php
} else {
  header("Location: /verification.php?continue=" . str_replace("/index.php", "", $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]));
}
?>

4. Done!
